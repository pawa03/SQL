###In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1.How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'order ID';

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'order ID';

3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
 JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fes
 ON cust.order_ID=fes.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'order ID';

4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, Min(price) AS cheapest_Pr
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product,price
ORDER BY price 
LIMIT 1;
#OR 
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

5.List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT  Product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

6.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT product, sum (quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

7.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT distinct product ,sum(quantity),  sum(quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

8.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT( distinct cust.acctnum),AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fes
 LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
 ON fes.orderID=cust.order_ID
 WHERE quantity> 2
 AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'order ID';
