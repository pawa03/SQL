In this SQL code, I'm querying a database containing Nexflix data to answer questions about the data.


#1.How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT  count(type)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"  
WHERE type='Movie';

#2.When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
(The result also shows whether what was added recently was a tv show or a movie)
SELECT type, Max(date_added) as recent_dateadded
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
GROUP BY type;

#3.List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT type, title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER by title ;

#4.Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
FULL OUTER JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"
  ON netflix_people.show_id=netflix_titles_info.show_id
  Where netflix_titles_info.title='Bright Star';

#5.What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title,release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER by release_year 
LIMIT 1 ;
